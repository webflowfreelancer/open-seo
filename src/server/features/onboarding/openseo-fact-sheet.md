# OpenSEO Fact Sheet

This is the factual product reference for Sam, the OpenSEO onboarding agent. If a user asks about OpenSEO and the answer is not supported here, Sam should say it is not sure and point them to support instead of inventing details.

## What OpenSEO is

OpenSEO is an open-source SEO platform for keyword research, domain research, backlinks, rank tracking, site audits, Google Search Console, and AI-agent SEO workflows.

OpenSEO is built for people who want useful SEO data without a bloated enterprise SEO suite. It can be used as a hosted app or self-hosted from the open-source codebase.

OpenSEO is AI-native. It is designed to work with AI agents through MCP so users can ask an agent to run SEO research, inspect data, save findings, and continue work in the OpenSEO app.

OpenSEO does not claim to fully automate SEO. The product positioning is that SEO still needs strategy and judgment; OpenSEO helps users and AI agents collaborate on that work with real data.

## How OpenSEO helps with SEO strategy

SEO and marketing are intertwined. Getting more organic traffic starts with clear positioning: knowing who the product is for, what problem it solves, and which narrow topics the site can credibly own before trying to compete for broad, high-volume searches.

OpenSEO helps users turn that positioning into an SEO plan. It can surface relevant keywords, competitor gaps, Search Console opportunities, backlink context, and technical issues, but the goal is not to chase every keyword. The strongest early strategy is usually to build authority around a focused topic where the site has a real angle.

As the site earns topical authority in Google and AI systems, it becomes easier to compete for broader, higher-volume searches. OpenSEO helps users see that path: start with specific, winnable topics; publish and improve useful pages; build supporting links and internal structure; track what moves; then expand into adjacent and more competitive terms.

When explaining traffic growth, Sam should frame OpenSEO as a tool for making better SEO and marketing decisions, not as a magic traffic button. OpenSEO provides the data, workflows, and agent access; the user's positioning, content quality, distribution, and execution still matter.

## Hosted plan and credits

The managed OpenSEO app costs $20/month.

The managed plan includes:

- Keyword research, backlinks, rank tracking, and site audits.
- MCP server and agent skills for Claude, Cursor, ChatGPT-compatible clients, Codex, and other MCP clients.
- Google Search Console integration that does not use credits.
- $20.00 of usage credits each billing cycle.
- A 30-day money-back guarantee for the first charge.

OpenSEO uses usage credits for features that query paid SEO data providers, especially DataForSEO. Credit-using workflows include keyword volume, competitor data, backlinks, rank tracking, and site audits. Projects, settings, and data that has already been fetched do not cost credits to view.

Top-up credits can be purchased if monthly credits run out. Top-up credits roll over and do not expire. Monthly included credits reset each billing cycle.

Hosted users need an active subscription to use OpenSEO. If credits run out, OpenSEO should not create unexpected bills; users can buy more credits.

## Self-hosting

OpenSEO is open source and can be self-hosted for free.

Self-hosted users bring their own provider API keys and pay providers such as DataForSEO directly. Self-hosting is appropriate for users who want more control, privacy, customization, or provider-level billing.

The open-source repository is at `https://github.com/every-app/open-seo`.

## Data sources

OpenSEO uses DataForSEO as its main SEO data provider. DataForSEO powers many paid SEO data workflows such as keyword metrics, domain research, backlinks, SERP data, and rank-tracking-related data.

Google Search Console data comes from the user's connected Search Console property and does not use credits.

## Google Search Console

Hosted OpenSEO can connect to Google Search Console without requiring the user to create a Google Cloud project or OAuth client.

Search Console access is read-only. OpenSEO requests read-only access and cannot change the user's Search Console account.

Search Console features include:

- Search performance data: clicks, impressions, CTR, and average position.
- Breakdown by query, page, country, device, and date.
- Up to 16 months of available Search Console history.
- URL inspection data such as index status, crawl information, canonical information, mobile checks, and rich-result checks.
- Up to 10 URLs per URL inspection call.

Search Console tools use zero OpenSEO credits because Google does not charge users to read their own Search Console data.

## MCP and AI agents

OpenSEO exposes an MCP server so compatible AI clients can call OpenSEO tools.

Hosted MCP endpoint:

```txt
https://app.openseo.so/mcp
```

The first MCP connection sends the user through OpenSEO login and authorization. After authorization, the MCP client can call OpenSEO tools with the project context and account scopes the user approved.

OpenSEO MCP works with MCP clients including Claude Code, Claude Desktop, Cursor, Codex CLI, Codex Desktop, and other clients that support remote MCP servers.

OpenSEO MCP tools cover workflows such as:

- Keyword research with volume, difficulty, CPC, intent, and trends.
- Live Google organic SERP inspection.
- Domain and page ranked keyword research.
- SERP competitor comparisons.
- Local business, Maps, Local Finder, and Google Business Profile Q&A research.
- Saved keyword listing and saving.
- Rank tracker config and latest position reads.
- Domain organic footprint summaries.
- Backlink and referring-domain overview data.
- Google Search Console performance reads.
- Google URL inspection reads.

OpenSEO also provides agent skills for workflows such as SEO project setup, SEO coaching, keyword research, competitive landscape analysis, competitor analysis, keyword clustering, and link prospecting.

## App workflows

OpenSEO's app includes these practical workflows:

- Keyword research: expand seed topics into keyword ideas, compare search volume, difficulty, CPC, intent, and SERP context, then save useful opportunities.
- Domain overview: understand a domain's organic footprint and ranking keywords.
- Backlink research: inspect backlinks, referring domains, target URLs, link quality signals, and competitor link profiles.
- Rank tracking: track keyword positions over time.
- Site audit: crawl pages and inspect technical page-level signals such as status codes, titles, meta descriptions, headings, indexability, image alt coverage, links, response time, and optional Lighthouse findings.
- Saved keywords: organize keyword opportunities for content planning, tracking, or AI-agent workflows.
- AI and MCP setup: connect OpenSEO to agents and install OpenSEO skills.

## What users can do after subscribing
