# Papercuts

Small, non-blocking friction in the repository itself — the kind that will
waste the next contributor's time too. Log it in the moment; review and fix
entries in a separate, user-requested cleanup pass.

This is not a completed-work log, a bug tracker, or a place for the agent's own
sandbox/shell/network hiccups. Never include secrets, credentials, personal
data, or sensitive paths.

## Open

- [ ] `2026-07-19T04:06:52Z` — `codex` — `pnpm --dir web build` fails with `vite: command not found` when `web/node_modules` is absent, despite the root toolchain being installed. Document or enforce the package-local install required before validating the `web/` subpackage.
- [ ] `2026-07-19T02:55:56Z` — `claude` — Adding a docs folder under `web/content/docs` whose `meta.json` lists an `[Overview](...)` link renders a duplicated, double-highlighted sidebar entry, because the folder-index strip in `web/src/lib/source.ts` (`transformPageTree.folder`) is a per-folder-name allowlist. Derive it from the meta convention (or strip the index for all folders) so new sections don't need a hidden source.ts edit.
- [ ] `2026-07-14T01:28:30Z` — `claude` — Regenerating the lockfile (adding or moving a dep) makes `pnpm install` re-run the `minimumReleaseAge` gate on transitive peers already pinned at that exact version (`mysql2`, `sql-escaper`, `@aws-sdk/credential-providers`), failing the install even though nothing about them changed. `pnpm install --config.minimumReleaseAge=0` — then confirm the lockfile diff stays version-neutral — unblocks it; worth documenting that regen step so the gate doesn't re-block already-pinned versions.
- [ ] `2026-07-10T21:28:46Z` — `codex` — `pnpm --dir badseo run typecheck` works through the root toolchain but `pnpm --dir badseo run build` can't find Vite because `badseo/node_modules` is absent. Document or enforce the package-local install before validating the `badseo/` subpackage.
- [ ] `2026-07-10T21:32:10Z` — `codex` — Formatting the `badseo/` workspace with `pnpm exec prettier` fails because Prettier is only available from the repository root. Document the root-only formatter command or expose a workspace-local formatting script.

## Resolved

- [x] `2026-07-20T18:39:13Z` — `codex` — A fresh `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` installs dependencies but exits nonzero with `ERR_PNPM_IGNORED_BUILDS` because required native build scripts are not recorded in the repository policy. Resolved 2026-07-20 by committing an explicit allow/deny build-script policy; frozen install and `pnpm ci:check` both pass.
